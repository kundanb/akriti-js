# Akriti

Akriti is an open-source and lightweight API for creating 2D Graphics with JavaScript. The library works upon HTML5 Canvas API. Akriti is a handful of functions that better manage drawing on the canvas.

# 🙄 Why should you choose Akriti?

When you are doing simple drawing, simple context function are enough. But at one time, many things come to play, such as handling the state of objects, animations, playing sounds, control buttons etc. Let's call them 🤔 **_components_**.

It gets annoying when you have a lot of work and want complete control. And the most annoying thing you will come across is doing the calculation of drawing different shapes and forms. Things can become handy 👌 if something is doing all this extra work for you. Here Akriti comes to save you.

Akriti helps you a lot in managing all these. It gives you a handful of control over **_objects_**, **_animations_**, **_sounds_** and **_their direction_**.

## 😎 How does Akriti help you?

Simply, it is simple. Akriti gives you a handful of tools to manage the following components:

- 📒 Modularization of Components
- 🎨 Shapes and Forms Precalculations
- ⚙ Object State Management
- 🎵 Audio Management
- 🎠 Animation Loop Management

These tools help a lot by doing the extra work for you.
